## 🎶 Music Genre Classifier

A simple machine learning web app that classifies `.wav` audio files into genres: **rock**, **jazz**, **pop**, or **classical**. It uses a CNN trained on MFCC features, with predictions served via Flask and a clean HTML frontend.

### 💾 Training Your Own Model (Optional)

You can train the model yourself using the included notebook. Place audio clips like this:

```
data/processed/
├── rock/rock_clip.wav
├── jazz/jazz_clip.wav
├── pop/pop_clip.wav
└── classical/classical_clip.wav
```

After training, the notebook will save:

```bash
music_genre_cnn_colab.h5
```
